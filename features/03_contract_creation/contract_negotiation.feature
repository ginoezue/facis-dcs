Feature: Contract Negotiation
  Contract Managers and Contract Reviewers negotiate contract terms through
  commenting, version tracking, and structured negotiation workflows with
  redline proposals and full audit logs.

    And contract "Service Agreement" is in "Draft" status
    When I open contract "Service Agreement" for negotiation
    Then the negotiation interface is displayed
    And I can view all contract clauses

  @clean_db
  Scenario: Add comment to contract clause
    Given I am authenticated with roles: "Contract Reviewer"

    And the comment is attributed to my identity
    And the comment includes a timestamp

  Scenario: Approve proposed change during negotiation
    Given I am authenticated with roles: "Contract Manager"
    And contract "Service Agreement" has a pending redline proposal on clause "Liability"
    When I approve the redline proposal
    Then the change is applied to the contract
    And the approval is logged in the negotiation log
    And a new version is created

  @clean_db
  Scenario: Reject proposed change during negotiation
    Given I am authenticated with roles: "Contract Manager"

    Then the proposal is marked as rejected
    And the rejection reason is logged
    And the original text is retained

  @clean_db
  Scenario: View negotiation log

    Then the request is denied with an authorization error

  # Rewritten to the DID-party semantics this backend actually implements
  # (see backend/internal/contractworkflowengine/db/contractrepository.go
  # Responsible{Reviewers,Negotiators,Approvers []string}, all peer DIDs, and
  # IsValidNegotiator in acceptnegotiation.go/negotiate.go/
  # rejectnegotiation.go): "party to the contract" = "this instance's own
  # peer DID is among the contract's registered negotiator DIDs" — there is
  # no organization/representative-of-party concept in the data model, only
  # DID membership. FR-CWE-18's intent (only parties may negotiate) is
  # preserved; "Acme Corp"/"TechVendor Inc" party-naming is not.
