# Real signing vertical - PAdES signature, EUDIPLO signing ceremony, PID
# binding (SRS: DCS-FR-SM-08/-14/-16/-18, DCS-IR-SI-10, DCS-FR-CWE-04).
#
# Harness notes (see steps/real_signing_vertical/
# dcs_real_signing_vertical_steps.py's module docstring for the full
# rationale behind each binding decision):
#
#   1. pdf-core's own POST /sign is not reachable from this harness at all
#      (only the backend is, via BDD_DCS_BASE_URL) - PAdES is exercised
#      indirectly through POST /signature/apply and by inspecting the PDF
#      bytes GET /pdf/export/contract/{did} serves afterwards, using the
#      same direct-byte-search technique established elsewhere in this
#      codebase's BDD packs.
#   2. EUDIPLO is never co-deployed here; this harness plays the "EUDIPLO
#      test client" role itself, POSTing a real, protocol-correct SD-JWT VC +
#      KB-JWT PID presentation straight at the ceremony webhook
#      (POST /signature/request/webhook, authenticated via the
#      X-EUDIPLO-Webhook-Secret shared-secret header), built with the
#      testWallet/dcs_wallet signing primitives.
#   3. Byte-level PDF assertions (SubFilter, x5chain, RFC3161 timestamp,
#      ByteRange coverage) are direct-byte-search heuristics, not a full PDF/
#      CMS/ASN.1 parse - each documents its own precision limit at its point
#      of use in the steps module.
#
# The Signature Manager UI (QR/poll/result modal, AES badge) has no coverage
# in this pack - this repo-root BDD harness has no browser-automation
# convention at all (see features/16_other/frontend.feature, a bare
# reachability check). The service-level contract the UI would call is
# already exercised by the ceremony scenarios below; the UI-specific
# rendering claims are recorded as an explicit coverage gap via the final
# @skip scenario, not fabricated.

Feature: Real signing vertical - PAdES signature, EUDIPLO ceremony, PID binding

  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  # PAdES signature production - pdf-core POST /sign, exercised indirectly
  # via POST /signature/apply after a completed ceremony (see steps module
  # docstring point 1).
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------

  @DCS-OR-C2PA-002 @DCS-OR-C2PA-010
  Scenario: Applying a signature produces a PDF with a cryptographically valid PAdES signature in the named AcroForm field
    Given contract "RSV AcroForm Contract" has an AES-signed PDF via a completed ceremony for signatory "SignerOne"
    Then the signed PDF for contract "RSV AcroForm Contract" contains a PAdES signature naming the signing party AcroForm field
    And the signed PDF for contract "RSV AcroForm Contract" has a structurally valid PAdES ByteRange

  @DCS-OR-C2PA-002 @DCS-OR-C2PA-010
  Scenario: The PAdES signature declares SubFilter ETSI.CAdES.detached with a full embedded x5chain
    Given contract "RSV SubFilter Contract" has an AES-signed PDF via a completed ceremony for signatory "SignerTwo"
    Then the signed PDF for contract "RSV SubFilter Contract" declares SubFilter ETSI.CAdES.detached
    And the signed PDF for contract "RSV SubFilter Contract" embeds a non-empty X.509 certificate chain

  @DCS-OR-C2PA-002 @DCS-OR-C2PA-010
  Scenario: The PAdES signature carries an RFC3161 timestamp from the configured TSA (PAdES-B-T)
    Given contract "RSV Timestamp Contract" has an AES-signed PDF via a completed ceremony for signatory "SignerThree"
    Then the signed PDF for contract "RSV Timestamp Contract" embeds an RFC3161 timestamp token

  @DCS-OR-C2PA-002 @DCS-OR-C2PA-010
  Scenario: The order /update -> /sign -> /update leaves the PAdES signature and C2PA chain valid
    Given contract "RSV Order Contract" has an AES-signed PDF via a completed ceremony for signatory "SignerFour"
    When the signature for contract "RSV Order Contract" is revoked as a post-sign C2PA update
    Then get http 200:Success code
    When I re-export the signed PDF for contract "RSV Order Contract"
    Then the signed PDF for contract "RSV Order Contract" still has a structurally valid PAdES signature
    When contract "RSV Order Contract" is exported and verified as PDF
    Then get http 200:Success code
    And the verification result shows match is true

  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Contract signer + apply flow
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------

  @DCS-FR-SM-16 @DCS-IR-SI-10
  Scenario: The applied signature is a real PAdES signature persisted with an IPFS CID, not the stub placeholder
    Given contract "RSV No Stub Contract" has an AES-signed PDF via a completed ceremony for signatory "SignerFive"
    Then the contract_signatures row for contract "RSV No Stub Contract" is a real signature, not the STUB placeholder

  @FR-SM-18 @DCS-IR-SI-10
  Scenario: The apply endpoint honors the requested signer_did and credential_type instead of discarding them
    Given contract "RSV Apply Fields Contract" is APPROVED and has completed a signing ceremony for signatory "ExplicitFieldsSigner"
    When contract signer applies a signature to contract "RSV Apply Fields Contract" using the ceremony's signer_did and credential_type "AES"
    Then get http 200:Success code
    And the signature envelope for contract "RSV Apply Fields Contract" reflects the ceremony's signer_did and credential_type "AES"

  @DCS-FR-SM-16 @FR-SM-25 @UC-04-02
  Scenario: Apply is refused with a typed error until a completed PID presentation exists for the signer
    Given contract "RSV Ceremony Gate Contract" has reached contract state "APPROVED"
    When contract signer applies a signature to contract "RSV Ceremony Gate Contract" without a prior signing ceremony
    Then the apply request is rejected with a typed ceremony-required error

  @DCS-FR-CWE-04
  Scenario: The signature record binds both the PDF hash and the JSON-LD content hash
    Given contract "RSV Dual Hash Contract" has an AES-signed PDF via a completed ceremony for signatory "SignerSix"
    Then the contract_signatures row for contract "RSV Dual Hash Contract" records both a PDF hash and a JSON-LD content hash

  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  # EUDIPLO signing ceremony (see steps module docstring point 2)
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------

  @FR-SM-14
  Scenario: POST /signature/request starts a ceremony for an authorized Contract Signer
    Given contract "RSV Ceremony Start Contract" has reached contract state "APPROVED"
    When I start a signing ceremony for contract "RSV Ceremony Start Contract" field "SignerSeven" as "Contract Signer"
    Then get http 200:Success code
    And the ceremony response includes a ceremony_id, wallet_uri, and expires_at

  @FR-SM-14
  Scenario: POST /signature/request denies a caller without an authorized signing role
    Given contract "RSV Ceremony Denied Contract" has reached contract state "APPROVED"
    When I start a signing ceremony for contract "RSV Ceremony Denied Contract" field "SignerEight" as "Contract Observer"
    Then the ceremony start request is denied for that role

  @FR-SM-14
  Scenario: GET /signature/request/{id} reports the ceremony's lifecycle status as it progresses
    Given contract "RSV Ceremony Status Contract" has an AES-signed PDF via a completed ceremony for signatory "SignerNine"
    When I poll the signing ceremony status for contract "RSV Ceremony Status Contract"
    Then get http 200:Success code
    And the signing ceremony for contract "RSV Ceremony Status Contract" has status "verified"

  @NFR-SEC-18 @FR-SM-14
  Scenario: The webhook receiver marks the ceremony verified and persists PID claims when the shared secret is correct
    Given contract "RSV Webhook Auth Contract" has reached contract state "APPROVED"
    When I start a signing ceremony for contract "RSV Webhook Auth Contract" field "SignerTen" as "Contract Signer"
    Then get http 200:Success code
    When the EUDIPLO webhook confirms the presentation for contract "RSV Webhook Auth Contract" with the correct shared secret
    Then get http 200:Success code
    When I poll the signing ceremony status for contract "RSV Webhook Auth Contract"
    Then the signing ceremony for contract "RSV Webhook Auth Contract" has status "verified"

  @NFR-SEC-18 @FR-SM-14
  Scenario: The webhook receiver rejects a request presenting an incorrect shared secret
    Given contract "RSV Webhook Bad Secret Contract" has reached contract state "APPROVED"
    When I start a signing ceremony for contract "RSV Webhook Bad Secret Contract" field "SignerEleven" as "Contract Signer"
    Then get http 200:Success code
    When a caller posts the EUDIPLO webhook for contract "RSV Webhook Bad Secret Contract" with an incorrect shared secret
    Then the webhook request is rejected for the incorrect shared secret

  @UC-04-02
  Scenario: The ceremony completes headlessly by fulfilling the OID4VP presentation/webhook contract, no wallet UI involved
    Given contract "RSV Headless Ceremony Contract" has an AES-signed PDF via a completed ceremony for signatory "SignerTwelve"
    When I poll the signing ceremony status for contract "RSV Headless Ceremony Contract"
    Then get http 200:Success code
    And the signing ceremony for contract "RSV Headless Ceremony Contract" has status "verified"

  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Signer binding: the pseudonymous holder DID + signing-summary VC embedded
  # UNDER the signature (embed-first-sign-second). The PID itself is NEVER
  # embedded — personal data stays out of the shared PDF (eIDAS/GDPR).
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------

  @DCS-FR-SM-08 @NFR-SEC-18
  Scenario: The signer PID is NOT embedded in the signed PDF (privacy), only the pseudonymous binding
    Given contract "RSV Verbatim Presentation Contract" has an AES-signed PDF via a completed ceremony for signatory "SignerThirteen"
    Then the signer PID for contract "RSV Verbatim Presentation Contract" is NOT embedded in the signed PDF, only the pseudonymous binding

  @DCS-FR-SM-08
  Scenario: A ContractSigningSummaryCredential is issued and embedded under the signature
    Given contract "RSV Summary VC Contract" has an AES-signed PDF via a completed ceremony for signatory "SignerFourteen"
    Then a ContractSigningSummaryCredential for contract "RSV Summary VC Contract" is embedded inside the PAdES ByteRange

  # @skip — deferred BY DECISION. The wallet-driven remote-signing ceremony
  # produces the PAdES signature over the PDF; a detached JAdES over the
  # machine-readable JSON-LD is not yet emitted by the wallet/DSS path. The
  # vertical takes precedence; wallet-JAdES is follow-up research. Un-skip once
  # the ceremony emits the JAdES artifact.
  @DCS-FR-SM-02 @DCS-FR-SM-11 @skip
  Scenario: The ceremony also produces a JAdES signature over the machine-readable JSON-LD
    Given contract "RSV JAdES Contract" has an AES-signed PDF via a completed ceremony for signatory "SignerJades"
    Then the signature view for contract "RSV JAdES Contract" carries a JAdES signature that verifies over the contract JSON-LD

  # Uses the IPFS CID-swap seam (steps/support/tamper_seam.py). See
  # steps/real_signing_vertical/dcs_real_signing_vertical_tamper_steps.py's
  # module docstring for why the observable signal here is
  # /signature/validate's embedded-PID cross-check finding, not a literal
  # PAdES cryptographic signature verdict — no endpoint reachable by this
  # harness re-verifies the CMS signature over its /ByteRange, and
  # pdf-core's own /verify treats the entire PAdES-signed span (including
  # the evidence attachment) as an opaque, unchecked suffix by design.
  @DCS-FR-SM-08
  Scenario: Corrupting the signature-evidence attachment invalidates the embedded-PID cross-check
    Given contract "RSV Evidence Tamper Contract" has an AES-signed PDF via a completed ceremony for signatory "SignerEvidenceTamper"
    When the signature-evidence attachment for contract "RSV Evidence Tamper Contract" is corrupted on the server-stored PDF
    Then the signature validation findings for contract "RSV Evidence Tamper Contract" report the embedded signing evidence as invalid

  @UC-04-02 @UC-04-03
  Scenario: The verify side cross-checks the embedded signer binding against the signature record
    Given contract "RSV Verify Crosscheck Contract" has an AES-signed PDF via a completed ceremony for signatory "SignerFifteen"
    When I validate the signature for contract "RSV Verify Crosscheck Contract"
    Then get http 200:Success code
    And the signature validation findings for contract "RSV Verify Crosscheck Contract" cross-check the embedded signer binding

  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Full end-to-end
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------

  @UC-04-02 @UC-04-03 @DCS-FR-SM-16
  Scenario: End-to-end - accept, ceremony, AES-signed PDF, verify stays green, contract_signatures carries AES + ipfs_cid + ceremony link
    Given contract "RSV E2E Contract" has an AES-signed PDF via a completed ceremony for signatory "SignerSixteen"
    When contract "RSV E2E Contract" is exported and verified as PDF
    Then get http 200:Success code
    And the verification result shows match is true
    And the contract_signatures row for contract "RSV E2E Contract" is a real signature, not the STUB placeholder
    And the contract_signatures row for contract "RSV E2E Contract" is linked to a signature_ceremonies row

  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Signature Manager UI: documented coverage gap (see the header comment
  # above). No fabricated pass/fail - the traceability is kept present via
  # @skip.

  @skip
  Scenario: Signature Manager UI ceremony flow and AES badge - not provable from this HTTP-only BDD harness
    # This repo-root BDD harness has no browser-automation convention (see
    # features/16_other/frontend.feature - a bare reachability check). The
    # service-level contract the UI would call (start ceremony, poll status,
    # apply, AES credential_type) is already exercised end-to-end by the
    # ceremony and e2e scenarios above. The UI-specific claims (the
    # QR/poll/result modal and the AES badge render,
    # frontend/ClientApp/src/services/signature-management-service.ts) need
    # a browser-level test this harness does not have; recorded here as an
    # explicit coverage gap, not a fabricated result.
    Given I am authenticated with roles: "Contract Manager"
