Feature: Generate Contract from Template
  Contract Creators generate contract instances
  by populating approved templates with data.
  
  Scenario: Generate contract from approved template
    Given I am authenticated with roles: "Contract Creator"
    And template "Standard NDA" is in "Approved" status
    When I generate a contract from template "Standard NDA"
    Then a contract is created

  Scenario: Unauthorized role cannot generate contract
    Given I am authenticated with roles: "Template Approver"
    And template "Standard NDA" is in "Approved" status
    When I generate a contract from template "Standard NDA"
    Then the request is denied with an authorization error
