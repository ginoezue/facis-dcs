# ADR-12: Wallet-driven remote AES — the DCS is the relying party, not the signatory

## Status

Accepted, rolling out (2026-07-18). **Supersedes the organizational-signature
clause of [ADR-3](adr-3-signing-semantics.md)** (org-key AES over the PDF) and
removes "PAdES contract signatures" from [ADR-1](adr-1-key-custody.md)'s list of
DCS key-custody touchpoints. Everything else in ADR-3 (embed-then-sign ordering,
mandatory PID ceremony, identity binding inside the signed byte range) stands.

**What is built today** (see "Implementation state" below): the DCS-side
acceptance path — `POST /signature/prepare`, `POST /signature/submit`, the DSS
sole-control validation gate — and the removal of the eIDAS-invalid
DCS-signs-via-a-shared-DSS-key detour. **Still transitional:** the original
`POST /signature/apply`, where the DCS produces the PAdES itself through
pdf-core's PKCS#11 path, remains the default the signing UI and BDD use; it is
removed once they migrate to prepare/submit.

## Context

ADR-3 had the DCS's own HSM key produce the contract's AES over the PDF. That
is **legally void under eIDAS**: an Advanced Electronic Signature (Art. 26)
must be created with data the signatory keeps under their **sole control**
(26c) and be **uniquely linked to** and **identify** the signatory (26a, 26b).
A single DCS HSM key signing on behalf of every user is structurally a PAdES
but legally the DCS's signature, not the user's — and it cannot be sole
control when many users share it. An independent, conversation-blind research
pass over the EUDI reference implementations and the consolidated eIDAS text
confirmed both the defect and the corrected direction; Art. 26 is
custody-neutral (Recital 52 permits a remotely-held key under sole control),
and AES needs no QSCD or qualified certificate — that is QES, which is out of
scope (SRS line 199, ADR-3 TBD-A).

The SRS already describes the correct shape: the **wallet** manages the
signer's credentials and performs the signature (SM-06), and the DCS applies
signatures **via an integrated signing service** and enforces integrity
validation upon signing (SM-16), over a standard wallet/TSP interface
(IR-SI-04, IR-SI-10, IR-CI-08).

**Product-scope constraint:** FACIS.DCS does **not** ship a wallet, a QTSP, or
a signature-creation application. Those are separate ecosystem components (a
real EUDI wallet, a real QTSP/RSSP). Our job is to build the DCS correctly and
**prove** it covers the signing requirements against a real remote-signing
counterpart — simplifying only where the simplification is test-only.

## Decision

The DCS is the **OpenID4VP "Document Retrieval" relying party and signature
validator**. It **holds no contract-signing key** and never runs a signature
creation application (SCA). The signatory's key lives in their wallet/QTSP.

1. **Prepare.** The DCS seals the offer into the `odrl:Agreement`, runs the
   closedness/conformance/SHACL and policy gates, embeds the PoA presentation
   and the `ContractSigningSummaryCredential`, and places the AcroForm
   signature field — producing the **to-be-signed** PDF and the canonical
   JSON-LD payload. No signature is applied. (Embed-then-sign, ADR-3, is
   preserved: the wallet's signature covers the already-embedded evidence.)
2. **Publish.** The DCS publishes a **standard OID4VP Document-Retrieval
   request object** (signed JAR, `client_id_scheme=x509_san_dns`) carrying
   `document_digests`, `document_locations`, `response_uri`, and `nonce`, as a
   QR / deep link. `document_digests` is an array: the PDF **and** the JSON-LD
   are offered together, so one ceremony yields both a PAdES and a JAdES over
   the **same content hash** (SM-02, SM-11).
3. **Wallet signs (out of scope).** The wallet fetches the documents, presents
   the required PID/PoA to its QTSP, and drives its own SCA + QTSP to produce
   the signatures. What happens behind the wallet is **invisible to the DCS**.
4. **Receive + validate.** The wallet POSTs the signed documents back to
   `response_uri`. The DCS validates each (DSS `validateSignature`) and applies
   the **sole-control gate** (`dss.Report.AssertValidAES`): the AdES validation
   passed, a signing certificate is present, and that certificate **identifies
   the ceremony's signatory** — a shared or DCS-held key cannot satisfy this.
   It also checks the AdES level (SM-01/-02), the signing time, and credential
   status (SM-18).
5. **Finalize.** The DCS stores the signed PDF, records the signature (PAdES
   hash + JAdES), transitions to SIGNED, and archives — `Applier.finalize`.

## The wallet touch point

The boundary between the DCS (our product) and the wallet/QTSP (ecosystem) is
**exactly** the OID4VP Document-Retrieval interface. Nothing else crosses it.

```

**Directional invariants (the swap-breakers to never violate):**

- The DCS emits the **standard** OID4VP Document-Retrieval request object, not
  a bespoke JSON shape. This is what makes the test stand-in → real EUDI wallet
  a **configuration swap, not a code change**.
- The DCS hands over a **document** and gets back a **signed document**. It
  never exposes a "sign this hash" API to the wallet, never computes the DTBS,
  never runs the SCA, and never injects or pins the signer certificate — the
  signer certificate flows **from** the wallet/QTSP into the container.
- `client_id` is a DNS-bound X.509 the DCS controls (`x509_san_dns`), so the
  wallet can authenticate the request.

## Test edge (where, and only where, we simplify)

To prove the ceremony without shipping a wallet, a **headless test wallet+QTSP
stand-in** (`testWallet/dcs_wallet/`) plays the counterpart: it consumes the
request, fetches the documents, and produces a **genuinely valid** AES with a
**per-signatory key issued by a test CA** (DSS as the SCA). The DCS treats it
**identically** to a real wallet — same request object, same validation, same
sole-control gate. The simplification is entirely on the far side of the touch
point; the DCS code is production.

Production swap: point the ceremony at a real wallet scheme and a real QTSP/SCA
URL, and trust the QTSP's issuing CA instead of the dev CA. No DCS code change.

## Out of scope (explicitly not built by FACIS.DCS)

- A wallet or signature-creation application (SM-06 is a wallet requirement).
- A QTSP / RSSP or the CSC/rQES credential-authorization service.
- Deploying the EUDI reference QTSP/SCA/verifier stack — the test stand-in
  proves DCS conformance without it.
- QES / qualified certificates (SRS line 199; AES + PoA is the target).

## Consequences

- **Removed:** the eIDAS-invalid detour where the DCS produced the contract
  signature itself through a remote DSS with a shared key — `signer/dss.go`
  (`DSSSigner`), `dss/sign.go` (`getDataToSign`/`signDocument`), the
  `signer.NewContractSigner` backend toggle, `conf.SignerBackend`/`DSSURL`/
  `PAdESX5ChainPEM`, the `DCS_SIGNER_BACKEND`/`DCS_DSS_URL`/`DCS_PADES_X5CHAIN_PEM`
  env and the backend's pades-x5chain secret mount, and the `bdd-dss.yml` CI job.
- **Kept (legitimately DCS-signed with its own HSM key, ADR-1):** C2PA claim
  and lifecycle-assertion signatures, the signing-summary VC, OID4VP request
  objects (JAR), and the DCS-to-DCS synchronizer's JAdES transport envelope.
  These are the DCS attesting as itself, not as a contracting party.
- **Kept until migration (transitional):** the pdf-core PKCS#11 PAdES signer
  (`signer.PDFCoreSigner` → pdf-core `/sign` → `/internal/pades/sign` with the
  HSM `dcs-contract-pades` key) behind `POST /signature/apply`. This is the
  DCS-as-signatory shape ADR-12 replaces; it stays only until the signing UI and
  BDD move to prepare/submit, then it and its HSM key are removed.
- A verifier who trusts a submit-path signature trusts the **signatory's**
  certificate, not the DCS's — sole control is provable from the artifact alone.

## Implementation state (2026-07-18)

| Piece | State |
| --- | --- |
| DSS validation report → signer identity + `AssertValidAES` sole-control gate | done (`dss/client.go`) |
| `apply.go` split into `prepare()` (to-be-signed) + `finalize()` | done |
| `Applier.Prepare` (embed evidence, no signing) + `Applier.SubmitSignature` (validate + finalize) | done |
| `POST /signature/prepare` + `POST /signature/submit` | done, reachable |
| DSS-as-DCS-signer detour removed | done |
| OID4VP Document-Retrieval request object (`oid4vp/request/docretrieval.go`) | done, not yet wired into `startCeremony` (the QR layer over prepare/submit) |
| Remove transitional `POST /signature/apply` + pdf-core `/sign` + HSM `dcs-contract-pades` | pending UI + BDD migration |
| Test wallet+QTSP stand-in drives prepare → sign → submit; BDD/Playwright per-signatory-cert assertions | pending |

Between `prepare` and `submit` the contract stays APPROVED (the sealed agreement
is persisted at prepare, so the signed content is frozen); a dedicated
`PENDING_SIGNATURE` state and persisting the exact to-be-signed bytes are a
possible refinement, not required for the acceptance path to be sound.

## SRS coverage

| SM-01 (SES/AES/QES levels; QES descoped) | AdES level asserted from the DSS report |
| SM-02, SM-11 (PAdES + JAdES, same content hash) | `document_digests[]` — one ceremony, both artifacts |
| SM-03/-04/-05 (identity + PoA validated) | PID/PoA presentation in the ceremony; embedded pre-signature |
| SM-06 (wallet manages credentials + signs) | the wallet is the signatory across the touch point |
| SM-16 (apply via integrated signing service; integrity upon signing) | OID4VP RP + `AssertValidAES` sole-control gate |
| SM-18 (validate container/integrity/timestamp/status) | DSS `validateSignature` + status + signing time |
| SM-08 (signing summary VC in PDF/A-3) | embedded at prepare, inside the signed byte range |
