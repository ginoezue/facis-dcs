"""BDD steps for the local trust policy endpoint (PDP) gate (ADR-18,
docs/adr-18-federation-agreement-credential.md, requirement slug
`fed-agreement`, AC7-AC10).

Per the ADR: "The trust gate POSTs {peerDID, agreementCredential, direction,
contractDID, targetState} to DCS_TRUST_PDP_URL; 2xx allows, anything else —
including an unconfigured URL or an unreachable endpoint — denies and raises
an incident in the audit trail (fail-closed)." This is consulted on BOTH the
outbound ship path (dcstodcs.DCSToDCSSynchronizer.shipContractPDF) and the
inbound receive path (dcstodcs service PostPdf) — neither calls it yet
(ADR-18's implementation-state table marks the PDP gate itself "pending"),
so every scenario here is expected to fail red.

Unified terminal semantics (architect decision): every PDP failure mode —
a non-2xx deny, an unset DCS_TRUST_PDP_URL, or an unreachable endpoint — is
EQUALLY terminal: the interaction is rejected, exactly one incident is
recorded, and NO sync_fails retry entry is ever created for a PDP-caused
rejection. There is no "transient, worth retrying" PDP failure mode — that
distinction only applies to AC6's DIFFERENT agreement-credential gate (layer
3a), which does still get a sync_fails entry (see
dcs_peer_trust_steps.py's step_then_a_refuses_to_ship_cross_instance).

Controllable trust-PDP: the orce Node-RED flow (NOT a local BDD-process HTTP
stub)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
An earlier version of this module ran its own `ThreadingHTTPServer` inside
the BDD test process and expected the DCS-under-test's `DCS_TRUST_PDP_URL`
to point directly at it. That does not work against the kind/Helm harness:
the DCS pod runs in a different network namespace than the BDD process, so a
plain socket bound in this process is not reachable from the backend (the
same reachability problem steps/contract_deployment/
dcs_contract_deployment_steps.py already documents for its own ORCE target).

Both DCS instances are instead wired (harness-side, not by this module) with
`DCS_TRUST_PDP_URL=http://dcs-orce:1880/trust-pdp` — the already-deployed
orce Node-RED chart, reachable from the backend pods AND (via its own
port-forward) from this BDD process. The flow itself exposes a small control
surface this module drives:
  - `POST {control}/trust-pdp/mode {"mode": "allow"|"deny"|"silent"}` sets
    how `/trust-pdp` itself responds: 200 OK, 4xx/5xx, or (for "silent") no
    response at all, so the backend's own HTTP client times out against it —
    a genuine client-observed unreachable endpoint, not a fabricated one.
  - `GET {control}/trust-pdp/last` returns the most recently received
    `/trust-pdp` request body, for AC9's field-shape assertion and AC7's
    "was it consulted at all" check.

`BDD_TRUST_PDP_CONTROL_URL` (default `http://localhost:18880`, the harness's
own orce port-forward) is the control-plane address used by THIS BDD
process; it does not need to equal `DCS_TRUST_PDP_URL` itself (that one is
only ever resolved backend-side, inside the cluster).

Every Given step here resets the flow's mode back to "allow" after the
scenario via `context.add_cleanup` (behave-guaranteed to run whether the
scenario passes or fails) — otherwise a denying/silent mode set by one
scenario would leak into and break every later federation scenario sharing
the same long-lived orce deployment.
